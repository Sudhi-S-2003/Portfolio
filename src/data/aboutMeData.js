		bio: `Hello! I'm Sudhi, a passionate MERN stack developer with a solid foundation in full-stack web development. I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Kerala University, where my interest in development truly began to take shape. During my college years, I undertook an ERP project that allowed me to dive deep into various aspects of software development, including project management, HR management, and customer support. I self-learned Django through YouTube and Google, which fueled my passion for IT and development. This led me to pursue further studies in the MERN stack at Avodha, where I honed my skills in creating APIs, developing e-commerce solutions, and more.`,
